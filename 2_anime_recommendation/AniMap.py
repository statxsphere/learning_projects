The AniMap is designed for people that are new to anime. It's an easy-to-use, interactive way to go through a plethora of anime to help you find the right one to start (or continue) your journey with. Here's how it works: 

* The map (below) is divided first by medium of consumption (outer most), and then by genre, and then the individual anime (inner most).
* The size of each box represents the number of members, i.e, the popularity of that label.
* The darkness of shade represents how highly the anime was rated.
* You can zoom in to a category by clicking on it. You can zoom out by clicking the outer label on the top end of the map.
* You can hover over any element to get details on it. 
* Navigate through this map to find the kind of anime you feel most like watching.
